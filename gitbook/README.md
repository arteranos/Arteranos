* **Decentralized**\
  Just connect to any server you'd like, or set up a new server if you want. _Your server, your rules._
* **Open Source**\
  Download and build your own edition from scrstch. Enhance as you like.
* **Seamless mode switching**\
  Start up as in Desktop mode, and switch to VR. Or vice versa.
* **Configurable VR controls**\
  Left-handed? Controller broken? Annoyed with your idle hand sticking on your forehead, again? That can be remedied.
