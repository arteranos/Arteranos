# Quick start

You can jump in right here by downloading and installing the latest version [in the release page](https://github.com/willneedit/Arteranos/releases). Once install, just run the Arteranos client (just 'Arteranos'), just wait for the existing servers come up, and start looking around... 

But, if you're daring or you want to delve into the gritty details, you can compile Arteranos - both client and server - on your own, right from the source.

Even if you don't want to compile Arteranos from scratch, if you want to create object collections ("kits", the Altspace veterans named them) or world _templates_, you'd need to use the Arteranos source together with Unity itself as the development environment.
