*   Offline

    **You are alone**, best suited for setting up, like uploading your avatar and icons, setting your preferences, and so on.
*   Server

    Mainly with the dedicated server, the app works as the server. Users can connect and log in... but you're not logged in.
*   Client

    You have connected to another server. Others can be logged on, and you can explore the server's world as you like.
*   Host

    The server and client combined. You offer up your computer as a server to log in into the world you loaded, and you enter it, too. Keep in mind, exiting Arteranos or going offline will disconnect all logged-in users.



* Firewalled\
  A router or a firewall controls your connection to the internet. Connectivity could be impaired due to port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT).
* Public\
  Your router or the firewall (if existing) is reconfigured to allow incoming connections to the two ports toward to your computer, acting as server and the host mode.\
