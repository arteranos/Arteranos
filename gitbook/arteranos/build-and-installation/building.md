# Building

1. Download the source using git: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/willneedit/Arteranos.git`
   * Of course you can use Github Desktop. But using a command line is much safer than a GUI where you'd surely prone to having misclicks and forgetting option checks... like using submodules. Or not.
2. Open the Arteranos as the Unity project (adding Arteranos's directory in Unity Hub, then open it)
3. In Unity's menu, there's a custom menu heading named `Arteranos`. From there, select `Build Installation Package`
4. If all goes well, please find the newly created `build` folder including the installation wizard, `ArteranosSetup.msi` (or `ArteranosSetup.exe` as an alternative), amongst other files.
   * Also, you'll find the `Arteranos.exe` and `Arteranos-Server.exe`, respectively.
