# Traveling

You can travel to world and servers with several methods, all with the "travel" pane in the System menu.

### Travel to world...

Shows a prioritized list of worlds, both with the favourited worlds, worlds with friends residing in, and pepular worlds.

* `Visit world` means to connect to a matching server (meaning, server with friends or a good coverage of the content filters). If there is no server available, Arteranos puts up the host mode and logs you in -- technically, putting a server online for visiting the specific world for you and your friends.
* `Change world` You and all logged-in users will experience a world-changing event... pun intended :) The server will switch worlds, and commands all the connected clients will go along.

### Travel to server...

Shows a list of servers. Allows you to connect to a specific server, regardless which world is loaded.

Additionally, the are two buttons govern Arteranos's behavior:

* `Set Server content filters` - To set the content preferences. Servers with poor match will be prioritized down.
* `Server with custom TOS allowed` - Legalese. Yech. There is a default 'Don't be evil' blurb, but server administators can change their rules of conduct. Unchecking this button will filter out those servers.
