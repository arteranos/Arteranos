# Running

Arteranos can be started in VR or 2D (aka Desktop) mode - and you can switch modes _anytime_, with

* open the system menu, with pressing `ESC` or a button on your controller
* select `Exit`
* check (or uncheck) `VR mode`

Arteranos remembers the last state on exiting. When you restart Arteranos and your VR headset is (again) connected, Arteranos starts up as VR mode.
