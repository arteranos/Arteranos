# Installation

Start the installation wizard, `ArteranosSetup.exe`, and follow its steps.

`Arteranos.exe` is the full-fledged client. You can use it in the desktop mode or VR, as you like, both for connecting to a server, or to host your own server, with or without your presence in the world you set up.

`Arteranos-Server.exe` is the dedicated server. It won't show anything, and it's intended to persist in the backgound and to consume minimal resouces and to be connected to from other's clients, maybe you.
