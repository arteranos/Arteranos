# Security policy

Note, this is not even an alpha - as of this time, there aren't semi-stable versions yet. Daring developers are encouraged to use the `master` branch, or even the more unstable branches. If you discover a security risk, let me know.

## Supported versions

| Versions   | Supported           |
|------------|---------------------|
| ~~0.0.1~~  | :white_check_mark:  |
| master     | :x:                 |


## Reporting a vulnerability

Using our [Discord server](README.md#getting-in-touch), you can DM me (or the rest of the staff) to report the vulnerability. If you can do the effort, create a private fork, patch the code, and put up the issue *together with the pull request*.
