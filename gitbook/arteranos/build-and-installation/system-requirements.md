# System requirements

* Windows 10/11, 64-Bit.
  * It's designed to be architecture agnostic, so more recent versions of Windows should likely work.
  * Other architectures (e.g. Linux) are in the planning stage
* OpenXR-supported tethered headset, _if applicable_\*
  * ~~Oculus~~ Meta Quest 2, using Oculus Link (both Air and cable)
  * Meta Quest 2, Virtual Desktop
  * Meta Quest 2, Steam Link
