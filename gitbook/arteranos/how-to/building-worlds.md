# Building worlds

Arteranos doubles as its own SDK to build worlds. Set up a build environment with Unity (which you've probably done), create a scene with similar settings in the 'default' scene (like, URP, plane centered to (0,0,0)...), and save.\
\
Then, keep your scene selected and use 'Build world as Zip'.

`Take Screenshot` allows you to take a screenshot on your scene _using the in-scene's primary camera_, not the Editor view.

Once the settings match your tastes, click `Build World Zip File`.

Then, to publish your new world, use `Travel to world...` and upload the new Zip file as mentioned in the following chapter.
