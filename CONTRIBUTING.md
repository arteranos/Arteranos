# How to contribute

Greetings - I'm glad to help, because we need volunteer developers to push this project forward.

If you haven't already, come find us in the Discord or other means, listed in the [Getting in touch](README.md#getting-in-touch) section in the README.md.

### Found a bug?

* **Ensure the bug is not already reported** searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/willneedit/Arteranos/issues).
* If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/willneedit/Arteranos/issues/new). Use a **title and clear description**, as much as the relevant information as possible, including the **steps to reproduce** and the system architecture and environment in question.

### Do you write a patch that fixes a bug?

I'm glad you made the effort!

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
  * Please base the PR on `master` brach or (if applicable) `dev`.
* Ensure the PR's description is clear and concise, preferably with the issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, ensure the patch matches the [coding conventions](#coding-conventions).

### Do you intend to add a new feature and change an existing one?

* Before you simply start writing code, please reach out to the Development Discord. Chances are that your feature addition and (more probably) changes could be discussed at length. *But, don't despair, new ideas are always appreciated.*

* Once you've received positive feedback, [put an issue into GitHub](https://github.com/willneedit/Arteranos/issues/new) and tack on the `enhancement` label to denote as a new feature, or a changed one.

### Coding conventions

Don't worry, once reading the code, you'd get the hang of it.

* Indent using four spaces, no tabs.
* List items or function arguments use a space after the comma, like [1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3].
* Code lines shouldn't extend past 132 columns to minimize horizontal scrolling.
* Braces around one-line instruction blocks would omitted to improve the code's brevity.

#### Thanks!
