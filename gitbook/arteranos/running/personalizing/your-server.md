# Your server

The system menu `Moderation` allows you to customize...

* The server name
* The description
* The icon
* The server's connectivity settings
* The server's content ratings settings

The server content ratings allows you to limit worlds which your server will offer. Users can set their content preferences to sort servers to their preferences.\
For example, a user who limits himself to PG-13 servers, servers allowing e.g. excessive violence would be prioritized down.

The server icon can be uploded, please refer to the chapter below:

{% endcontent-ref %}
