# Uploading content

Uploading content, be it avatars, 2D icons or world ZIP file can be from the following sources:

* A web URL (e.g. https://example.com/myIcon.jpg or https://models.readyplayer.me/65abbb0520e510f61aa76dce.glb?pose=T)
* A file on Your PC (e.g. "C:\Users\username\Downloads\65abbb0520e510f61aa76dce.glb")

Desktop mode is recommended for convenience.

Copy and paste works. If it's a file on your PC, look for the file in the _file_ explorer, **right**-click, and select `Copy Path`. Then, use CTRL-V on the appropiate text field.
