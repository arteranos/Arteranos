# Privacy Agreement and Terms Of Service

## Privacy Agreement

First of all, NO user identifiable data would be monetized or sold out to third party entities or companies for any purposes. Private data, as detailed below, are to be used for ensuring this server's smooth operation and providing this application's features.

### User ID
It's in two parts: The public key and the private (aka secret) key. The secret key resides in Your device, nowhere else. The public key identifies you in front of your friends and be saved in your friend's lists or your server operator's list if you're being banned. Both this and the user fingerprint (see below) can be deleted by wiping your settings data on your device. Old public keys saved on other people's lists will turn out as useless.

### User fingerprint
Represented in the 'other name' besides the nickname. It's derived from the User ID, but it's (nearly) impossible to get the User ID back from the fingerprint. Unless a user sets his online setting as 'invisible', the fingerprints are to be publicly seen because for the means of looking for friends across servers.

### IP Address
It's essential to connect to the server. IP addresses are being logged for the sole purpose to maintain the smooth operation, and only to be saved for user banning purposes.

### Device ID
The ID is generated in your computer and headset, and would only be saved for for user banning purposes in severe cases.

### Text messages, voice chat and movement
None of these data points are saved, only transmitted to the desired targets and discarded. 

Text messages will be end-to-end encrypted, and transmitted client to srver to client.

Voice chat (and movement) is transmitted client to server to all clients in the speaker's earshot or visibility range.

Be aware, other users can take photos and capture images from your user experience using the "Camera Drone" feature in the user Heads Up Display. Though, no image would be saved server-side -- the photographing user has to be present at that time for taking photos.

## Terms Of Service

In lieu of the smooth operation, there are to be some basic laws the users (You!) have to adhere to:

### No submitting user content posing copyright infringement or of questionable legality.

### Voice chat and text messages have to remain respectful. Avoid racist, sexist, harassing, or whatever -ist opinions.

### Keep your confidentiality and respect privacy.

### Text, voice chat, avatar design and the choice of nickname have to be appropiate to the server's 'mood', as with the server's content filtering settings.

### Actions disruptive for the server's smooth operations (Hacking, Exploit use, Denial-of-service attacks) result to the pertrator's banning.

### Ban evasion (e.g. creating a new User ID, using a VPN) lead to consequential bans with other operation modes.
