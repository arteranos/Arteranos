This is the modified version of the Adrenak UniVoice (ref. Third Party Notices), heavily refactored and streamlined for optimization and reducing bandwidth.

Some parts of the code could be recognizable, but its interfaces are incompatible, so you cannot replace the original Adrenak.UniVoice without adaptation.
